# RedFlag

Red flag, a women’s health tracker, is specifically designed to raise awareness of potentially harmful relationship patterns. 

Our aim is to ensure women detect early signs of toxic relationships through a recognition of behavior cycles and patterns.

Red flag functions as a journal. Events can be logged and patterns reviewed using the system generated infographics and activity log.

To log an event simply select the date and choose from a selection of options. The app provides clear categories and examples of digital, emotional, physical, and verbal abuse thereby ensuring documentation of a difficult nature is done with ease.

Media can also be added for documentation

The system will alert the user of concerning patterns in the hopes that the user will reach out for assistance. If the user opts to decline suggested help, the app will automatically add an emergency call button.
Looking forward, our goal is to use Machine Learning algorithms to decide when would be the best time to suggest help initially as well as after any subsequent event.

Security and privacy are our priority.  The product is disguised under a fully functional women’s health tracker. The product can be used solely as a women’s health tracker, which is the default mode - a mode that wouldn’t raise suspicion if someone were to search a user’s phone.

We believe identifying and recording patterns of behavior can benefit the user emotionally, psychologically, physically, and even legally.

It can take years for a woman in an abusive relationship to break the cycle. Our goal is to help women identify warning signals early on in a relationship, before it is too late. 

We are proud to partner with the Michal Sela Forum in this effort to save lives!
