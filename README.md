# Red Flag - Michal Sela Forum Hackathon

## Scope and Focus

The Michal Sela forum aims to put an end to domestic violence through the development of life
saving products. Red Flag aims to create an end-to end product that raises awareness of
potentially harmful relationship patterns. 

## Project Background

Michal Sela was brutally murdered in her own home in the presence of her baby daughter 6
months ago. Since then, the number of Israeli women murdered by domestic partners has
increased dramatically. Our aim is to ensure women detect early signs of toxic relationships
through a recognition of behavior cycles and patterns.

Red flag solution functions as a journal. Events can be logged and patterns reviewed using the
system generated infographics and activity log. The product is disguised under a fully functional
women’s health tracker. The product can be used solely as a women’s health tracker, which is
the default mode - a mode that wouldn’t raise suspicion if someone were to search a user’s
phone.

## Key Features

**Security:** User should be able to get in and out of the relationship tracker safely and easily.

**Recording events:**  User should be able to record distressing events in a way that doesn’t
exacerbate the situation. User should be able to view activity log for personal and legal use.

**Negative patterns:**  User should be able to recognize emerging patterns. System should be able
to notify user of patterns the user may have dismissed.

**Help:** System should be able to recognize and offer direct access to social services.

**Women’s health:** User should be able to use tracker in women’s health tracker mode as well

## Vision & Impact

Our vision is to make the world a safer place for women through the early detection of abusive
patterns. We aim to bring this product to the global market, where access to help is customized
based on location. Looking forward, our goal is to use Machine Learning algorithms to decide
when would be the best time to suggest help initially as well as following any subsequent event.

### We are proud to partner with the Michal Sela Forum in this effort to save lives!
